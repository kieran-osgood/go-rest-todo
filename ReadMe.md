# Get Started
In order to run the application you must have Docker and Docker-compose installed.

Run in two separate terminals `make up` and `make air`.

`make up` will initialise the database and admin facilities for managing the database.
`make air` enables live reloading of the application. Alternatively you can run `go get ./...` and then use `make run` after each save to view changes.
